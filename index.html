			#FAQs - Frequently Asked Questions
		</h2>
		<br>
		<h3>
			How long does the Covid-19 vaccine last
		</h3>
		<li>
			So far, Pfizer's ongoing trial indicates the company's two-dose vaccine remains highly effective for at least six months, and likely longer. People who got Moderna's vaccine also still had notable levels of virus-fighting antibodies six months after the second required shot.
		</li>
		<h3>
			Can COVID-19 spread through food?
		</h3>
		<li>
			There is no evidence that COVID-19 can be spread through contact with food or food packaging. COVID-19 is generally thought to be spread from person to person. However, it’s always important to practice good hygiene when handling food to prevent any food-borne illnesses.
		</li>
		<h3>
			What are foods to avoid during the COVID-19 pandemic?
		</h3>
		<li>
			COVID-19 is often more severe in people 60+yrs or with health conditions like lung or heart disease, diabetes or conditions that affect their immune system.​
		</li>
		<h3>
			Can I get the coronavirus disease from swimming in a swimming pool?
		</h3>
		<li>
			Swimming in a well-maintained, properly chlorinated pool is safe. However, it is advisable to stay away from al crowded areas including crowded swimming pools. Keep 1 metre distance from people who sneeze or cough even in a swimming area.
		</li>
		<h3>
			Is a smoker at a higher risk of getting the COVID-19 virus than that a non-smoker?
		</h3>
		<li>
			At the time of preparing this Q&A, there are no peer-reviewed studies that have evaluated the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection associated with smoking. However, tobacco smokers (cigarettes, waterpipes, bidis, cigars, heated tobacco products) may be more vulnerable to contracting COVID-19, as the act of smoking involves contact of fingers (and possibly contaminated cigarettes) with the lips, which increases the possibility of transmission of viruses from hand to mouth. Smoking waterpipes, also known as shisha or hookah, often involves the sharing of mouth pieces and hoses, which could facilitate the transmission of the COVID-19 virus in communal and social settings.
